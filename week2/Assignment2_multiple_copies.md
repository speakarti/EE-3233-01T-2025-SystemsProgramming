### Developer Machine Setup : vscode for c/c++ on windows
=============================
- Install VSCode
- setup gcc, g++, gdb using https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp for windows (mingw tool chain, msys2 shell)
- Refer -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMWD7wfhgNY

## ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Abstract**: This lab is about writing a c program taking 3 arguments, and copies contents of one file to another two, using system calls to open, read, write.


| File                  | Description                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| [multiple_copies.c](./multiple_copies.c) | Contains 'c' code to make two copies of a source file, using system calls open, read, write files after reading bytes as buffer


## Execution Steps

**Case 1: main functionality to copy contents of source file into two destination files**
1. Input Arguments: The program should accept three command-line arguments:
    - source_file: The file whose contents need to be copied.
    - destination_file1: The first file where the contents will be copied to.
    - destination_file2: The second file where the contents will be copied to.

**Case 2: Argument Count Check** The program should check if exactly three arguments (excluding the program name) are provided. If not, it should display the following error message:
    Usage: multiple_copies source_file destination_file1 destination_file2

**Case 3: Source File Existence Check** Before attempting to copy, the program should check if the source_file exists. If it doesn't, display an error message:
    Opening Error!: [source_file_name]

**Case 4: Destination File Overwrite** If either of the destination files already exists, the program should overwrite its contents without any prompt.

### Conclusion:
I have leant the flow of compiling and executing c code in VScode (an IDE environment). And most important I have learnt how commnads in Unix/Linux are getting created. How actuall cp command is programmed. This is good learning to practice development with actual tools.




## Source Code
<pre> ```c

// using system calls (open, read, write and close).
// Build Instructions: gcc multiple_copies.c -o multiple_copies
// Run Instructions: ./multiple_copies source_file destination_file1 destination_file2
// Run Instructions: ./multiple_copies "read_test_file.txt" "destination_file1.txt" "destination_file2.txt"
// Example: /multiple_copies input.txt copy1.txt copy2.txt

/*
Requirements:
1. Input Arguments: The program should accept three command-line arguments:
    source_file: The file whose contents need to be copied.
    destination_file1: The first file where the contents will be copied to.
    destination_file2: The second file where the contents will be copied to.

2. Argument Count Check: The program should check if exactly three arguments (excluding the program name) are provided. If not, it should display the following error message:
    Usage: multiple_copies source_file destination_file1 destination_file2

3. Source File Existence Check: Before attempting to copy, the program should check if the source_file exists. If it doesn't, display an error message:
    Opening Error!: [source_file_name]
    Replace [source_file_name] with the actual name of the source file provided.

4. Destination File Overwrite: If either of the destination files already exists, the program should overwrite its contents without any prompt.

Unlimited Attempts Allowed
Objective: Write a C program named multiple_copies that copies the contents of a source file to two specified destination files. You must use system calls (open, read, write and close).

DO NOT USE LIBC functions (fopen, fread, fwrite, fclose). System calls can be called from C++, so you can use that if you're more comfortable in C++ than in C. (replace gcc with g++ in the build instructions)

Build Instructions:
gcc multiple_copies.c -o multiple_copies
Run Instructions:
./multiple_copies source_file destination_file1 destination_file2
Example:
./multiple_copies input.txt copy1.txt copy2.txt
Requirements:
Input Arguments: The program should accept three command-line arguments:
source_file: The file whose contents need to be copied.
destination_file1: The first file where the contents will be copied to.
destination_file2: The second file where the contents will be copied to.
Argument Count Check: The program should check if exactly three arguments (excluding the program name) are provided. If not, it should display the following error message:
Usage: multiple_copies source_file destination_file1 destination_file2
Source File Existence Check: Before attempting to copy, the program should check if the source_file exists. If it doesn't, display an error message:
Opening Error!: [source_file_name]
Replace [source_file_name] with the actual name of the source file provided.
Destination File Overwrite: If either of the destination files already exists, the program should overwrite its contents without any prompt.
Bonus: Write a python program that provides the same functionality

Turn in your source code files. Include your name in a comment at the top of the source code.
